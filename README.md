# CodeCrafters Interpreter

A [Lox Interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) made by following the [CodeCrafter Build your own Interpreter Course](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview). This project is only made for **personal learning** and is **not meant to be for production purposes**. Building an interpreter will help any developer deeply understand how languages are parsed and understood by computers under the hood. It is safe to say that it will be a big boost to your fundamental skills as a programmer. To see the original instructions from the **README.md** file provided by CodeCrafters, visit [**INSTRUCTIONS.md**](./docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
